Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Summary

The development process for the app was challenging yet rewarding. We encountered several hurdles along the way, such as losing our project at one point and needing to rebuild parts of it from scratch. Additionally, we had to devise creative workarounds for certain features and APIs we originally intended to implement but couldnâ€™t due to time constraints or technical limitations.

Despite these challenges, we persevered and successfully delivered a functional application that aligns with the core purpose of our original concept. The final product meets the essential requirements we envisioned, offering a streamlined experience for users and serving as a solid foundation for potential future enhancements.
